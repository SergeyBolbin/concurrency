Java provides two kinds of collections to use in concurrent applications:

Blocking collections:
    If the operation can't be made immediately, because the collection is full or
    empty, the thread that makes the call will be blocked until the operation can
    be made.

Non-blocking collections:
    If the operation can't be made immediately, the operation returns a
    null value or throws an exception, but the thread that makes the call won't
    be blocked.
