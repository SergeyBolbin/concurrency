Stale data:
------------------------------------------
When the reader thread examines ready, it may see an out of date value
Unless sync is used every time when a variable is accessed
Staleness is not all-or-nothing: a thread can see up to data value of one var, but staled value of another, that was written first

Reading without sync == READ_UNCOMMITED

out-of-thin-air-safety - when a T reads variable without sync, at keast it sees value that was placed by any thread, raher
then random value. Non-guarantee for 64-bit types (double, long) that are not declared volatile

JVM permitted to perform a 64-bit read and write as 2 32-bit
If the reads and writes occur in other threads, it is possible to read a nonvolatile long and
get back the high 32 bits of  one value and the low 32 bits of another


Syncronized guarantee:
----------------------------------------------
When  thread  A  executes  a  synchronized block,  and  subsequently  thread  B  enters a
synchronized block guarded by the same lock, the values of variables that were visible to A prior to releasing the lock
are guaranteed to be visible to B upon acquiring the lock.
Everything A did in or prior to a synchronized block is visible to B when it executes a
synchronized block guarded by the same lock. Without synchronization, there is
no such guarantee.


Publishing

Publishing an object means making it available to code outside of its current scope, such as by storing a reference to it
where other code can find it, returning it from a non-private method, or passing it to a method in another class.

Thread Confinement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If data is only accessed from a single thread,no synchronization is needed.
Example: JDBC connection pool, Stateless Beans etc, Swing event thread

- Ad-hock Thread Confinement (when the responsibility for maintaining thread confinement falls entirely on the implementation)
- Stack Thread Confinement (local variable esist on the current thread's stack which is not accessible for another thread)
- ThreadLocal associate per-thred value with a value-holding object

Immutability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An  immutable  object  is  one  whose  state  cannot  be  changed  after  construction.
Immutable  objects  are  inherently thread safe;
their invariants are established by the constructor, and if their state cannot be changed, these invariants always hold.

An object is immutable if:
- Its state cannot be modified after construction;
- All its fields are final;[12] and
- It is properly constructed (the this reference does not escape during construction).

Immutable objects, on  the  other hand, can be  safely  accessed even when  synchronization  is  not used  to  publish  the
object reference. For this guarantee of initialization safety to hold, all of the requirements for immutability must be met:
unmodifiable  state,  all  fields  are  final,  and  proper  construction.

This guarantee extends to the values of all final fields of properly constructed objects; final fields can be safely accessed
without additional synchronization. However, if final fields refer to mutable objects, synchronization is still required to
access the state of the objects they refer to.


Safe Publication Idioms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A properly constructed object can be safely published by:
 - Initializing an object reference from a static initializer;
 - Storing a reference to it into a volatile field or AtomicReference;
 - Storing a reference to it into a final field of a properly constructed object; or
 - Storing a reference to it into a field that is properly guarded by a lock.


Volatile variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a field is declared volatile, the compiler and
runtime  are  put on  notice  that  this  variable  is  shared  and  that  operations  on  it  should  not  be  reordered  with  other
memory  operations.  Volatile  variables  are  not  cached  in  registers  or  in  caches  where  they  are  hidden  from  other
processors, so a read of a volatile variable always returns the most recent write by any thread.

Volatile variables can be used for other
kinds of state information, but more care is required when attempting this. For example, the semantics of volatile are
not strong enough to make the  increment operation  (count++) atomic, unless you can guarantee  that the  variable  is
written only from a single thread.

 Volatile
 ------------------------------------------
 updates to a variable are propagated predictably to other threads.
 operations on it should not be reordered with other mem operations
 are not caches on registers or in cache processors

 When thread A writes to
 a volatile variable and subsequently thread B reads that same variable, the values of all variables that were visible to A
 prior to writing to the volatile variable become visible to B after reading the volatile variable. So

 writing a volatile variable is like exiting a synchronized block and reading a volatile variable is like entering
 a synchronized block.

 The  most  common  use  for  volatile  variables  is  as  a completion, interruption, or status flag

 You can use volatile variables only when all the following criteria are met:
     - Writes  to  the  variable  do  not  depend  on  its  current  value,  or  you  can  ensure  that  only  a  single  thread  ever
     updates the value;
     - The variable does not participate in invariants with other state variables; and
     - Locking is not required for any other reason while the variable is being accessed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The internal synchronization in thread safe collections means that placing an object in a thread safe collection,
such as a  Vector  or  synchronizedList,  fulfills  the  last  of  these  requirements.

If  thread  A  places  object  X  in  a  thread safe  collection and  thread B  subsequently  retrieves  it, B  is  guaranteed  to  see  the  state  of X  as A  left  it,  even  though  the
application code that hands X off in this manner has no explicit synchronization.

+ Placing a key or value in a Hashtable, synchronizedMap, or Concurrent-Map safely publishes it to any thread
that retrieves it from the Map (whether directly or via an iterator);

+ Placing  an  element  in  a  Vector,  CopyOnWriteArrayList,  CopyOnWrite-ArraySet,  synchronizedList,  or
synchronizedSet safely publishes it to any thread that retrieves it from the collection;

+ Placing  an  element on  a  BlockingQueue  or  a  ConcurrentLinkedQueue  safely  publishes  it  to  any  thread  that
retrieves it from the queue.

Static initializers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Static initializers are executed by the JVM at class initialization time; because of internal synchronization in the JVM, this
mechanism is guaranteed to safely publish any objects initialized in this way

Effectively Immutable Objects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objects that are not technically immutable, but whose state will not be modified after publication, are called effectively
immutable. They do not need to meet the strict definition of immutability in Section 3.4; they merely need to be treated
by the program as  if they were immutable  after  they are published.  Using  effectively immutable  objects can  simplify
development and improve performance by reducing the need for synchronization.

---------------------------
The most useful policies for using and sharing objects in a concurrent program are:
Thread-confined. A thread?confined object is owned exclusively by and confined to one thread, and can be modified by
its owning thread.
Shared  read-only.  A  shared  read?only  object  can  be  accessed  concurrently  by  multiple  threads  without  additional
synchronization,  but  cannot  be  modified  by  any  thread.  Shared  read?only  objects  include  immutable  and  effectively
immutable objects.
Shared  thread-safe. A  thread?safe  object performs  synchronization  internally, so  multiple  threads can  freely  access  it
through its public interface without further synchronization.
Guarded.  A  guarded  object  can  be  accessed  only  with  a  specific  lock  held.  Guarded  objects  include  those  that  are
encapsulated within other thread?safe objects and published objects that are known to be guarded by a specific lock.
